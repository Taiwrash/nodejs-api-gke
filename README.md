This project demonstrates expertise in Google Cloud, Kubernetes, Docker, and DevOps by deploying a Node.js API on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). It covers:

Containerization: Building and managing Docker images.
Cloud Deployment: Using Google Cloud services like GCR and Compute Engine.
Kubernetes Orchestration: Deploying, exposing, scaling, and updating applications on GKE.
CI/CD & Automation: Managing rolling updates and high availability with Kubernetes deployments.
This showcases proficiency in Cloud Infrastructure, Kubernetes Management, and DevOps Automationâ€”key skills for roles in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), DevOps, and Cloud Engineering.
